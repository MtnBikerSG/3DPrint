What is this?
This is a container for the toptube of the Giant Revolt gravel bike. I use it to keep snacks on long bike ride.

How should it be printed?
Since you need to add magnets at different parts of the container, print the top and bottom parts separately.
For support placement, specify only for surfaces touching the buildplate.

To insert the magnets, you would need to pause the printing at the right layer. Pausing can be done manually or by modifying the Gcode file. 

To modify the Gcode: after slicing the model, preview the layers. Note the first layer where the magnet will be
covered by the filament.

Next, from the main menu, select Extensions, Post-processing, Modify G-code. Add a "Pause at height" script, and use the following parameters:
- change from Height to Layer Number
- specify the layer to Pause.
- Park Print Head X to 0.0 mm
- Park Print Head Y to 0.0 mm
- Standby Temperature 160 deg C (for PLA)
- G-code before Pause: m300
- G-code after Pause: m300

Finally, slice the model again (with the script) and save the Gcode file.
